	While puzzles may present multiple solutions, this tries to find the 'optimal' ones.
	An 'optimal' solution is defined as having the shortest line that go through all given dots, with the least number of corners.
	A 3x3 puzzle with a single black dot in a corner will solve as a square (4 corners).
	Any single black dot puzzle solves to a 3x3 square (line goes 2 lengths).
	A single white dot puzzle solves to a 3x2 rectangle (has to turn previous and/or next square).
